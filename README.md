# Welcome to my Zettelkasten!

The Zettelkasten method is a note-taking system invented by Niklas Luhmann. The whole method focuses on capturing knowledge in atomic notes written in your own words and connecting those pieces of knowledge through links. Each node should exactly hold one specific idea.

### How It Works

All the content that will be available for consumption resides in the inbox directory as a fleeting note with a special tag marking the note as consumable content. This allows us to pick beforehand what kind of content we are going to consume.

The following directories help structure the consumed content:

- Articles
- Courses
- Podcasts
- Videos
- Audiobooks
- Books

Based on the given input, we can create high-quality notes, which we can use to create content in the form of a blog post, an article, and, more importantly, leverage the gathered knowledge into hands-on experience.
