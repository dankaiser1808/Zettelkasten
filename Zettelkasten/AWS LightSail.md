#aws 

LightSail is another abstraction to simplify the interaction with AWS. It capsulates the core AWS services that are needed to run an application and minimizes the amount of configurations to make the interaction with the AWS ecosystem easier. This is very useful for small businesses, startups and developers who want to deploy their application without diving deeper into each of the services.
