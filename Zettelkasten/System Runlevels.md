# Runlevels

Traditional and older Linux systems define runlevels which are used to initialize multiple services for each level.

0 -> shuts down the system
1 -> single user mode (used for maintenance)
2 -> Multi user mode (no networking, but depends on distro)
3 -> Multi user mode (with networking)
4 -> Undefined (custom usage)
5 -> Multi-User with GUI
6 -> Reboot
