KMS (Key Management Service) is a Security service that gives us the utility to perform cryptographic operations like encrypting, decrypting, signing and verifying data. Some services use KMS under the hood by default, like S3 or EBS. Since dealing with a big amount of keys for an organization for different data, users and services can be very messy, KMS makes it easy for us to manage the keys and configure lifecycle, rotation and apply policies. Those policies include permissions like who can use the key and for what the key can be used for.
