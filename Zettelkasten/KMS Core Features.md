The benefits to use KMS are pretty clear:

- One single place to manage all keys
- used widely by the services of the AWS ecosystem
- Gives us a lot of control over the keys
- Automated Key Rotation gives us the extra security needed
- For companies that follow strict audit and compliance rules kms ensures we reach those security standards by keeping track of the keys usage.
