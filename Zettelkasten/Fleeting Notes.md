Fleeting notes are short quick captures of ideas with a limited lifespan. These notes are reminders of interesting content that should be processed. Later on, those notes will be transformed into permanent notes. Fleeting notes should be written while reading interesting content, or quickly capture the idea of high quality consumable content.
