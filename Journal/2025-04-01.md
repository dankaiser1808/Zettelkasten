Woke up pretty early today, despite of catching a cold and a hurting throat I'm still feeling pretty good. Yesterday, we had a power outage for about 2 hours which caused unavailability of my homelab. After the electricity was back, my cluster was up and running again within seconds. This just reminds me how powerful Kubernetes is.

Today I want to checkout Mischa Van den Burgs Zettelkasten method, a technique to gather knowledge in a time saving, structured manner.

Additionally I'm in the mood to work on my KodeKloud Engineer progress and go through the AWS hands on tasks, coupled with the AWS Solution Architect course.
