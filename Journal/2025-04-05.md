Woke up refreshed today. My cold is almost gone, just a little cough left but it's okay.

Today, I'm going to the local university to get a little bit out of the office and work in a different setup. It feels sometimes nice to get ready and leave your office.

Reached 75000 points on KodeKloud Engineer and got the title Senior Devops Engineer on the platform. You can't compare it to a real Senior DevOps Engineer of course, but it still shows commitment. 

Let's start the day with some AWS. A lot of the content I'm going over for the certificate is something I already know. However, reminding yourself of the basics and gI'm still thinking of creating a Arazzo testing tool in python. I think I'll brainstorm for this project a little bit today too.
