I need to keep my Kubernetes skills sharp. So I'll start this morning with some KodeKloud Engineer Kubernetes tasks.

I did all of the level 2 Kubernetes tasks and reviewed somebody else's task. All the practice for the CKA with kubectl really got into my muscle memory. Working with kubectl feels natural. 

Also noticed that I already did over 100+ tasks on KodeKloud Engineer. I'll store some of the tasks in my lab repo as small examples from now on, to revisit concepts like init container, sidecar containers and mounting a pvc.
