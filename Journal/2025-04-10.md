Went out for breakfast this morning, the weather is amazing. I installed the obsidian nvim plugin to write all of my nodes from now on in nvim to get deeper into vim. I always wanted to be more proficient with nvim, but I found myself mostly coming back to vscode.
Besides that, I'll also work on my Linux administration skills. A strong foundation of Linux is extremely important in DevOps.
