Today, I decided to eat healthier. Started the day with some oats, apples, electrolytes and coffee. Going to finish two Leetcode challenges as well as the AI Part of the SAA course.

I can really feel how this course just focuses on plain theory. It's good to know what services AWS offers and how they work together, but the lack of hands-on task is something I don't really like. After the course I'm going to create some terraform and AWS project that cover the most important parts of the course.

Todo:
- [x] Two Leetcode challenges
- [x] AWS SAA course AI part
