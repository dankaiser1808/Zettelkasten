Faced some issues with the KodeKloud Engineer yesterday, where I couldn't start tasks anymore. Checked this morning, problem still persists. Because of that, I'm going to polish my github readme for a little and focus on my substack post about my homelab secret management and dig deeper into the AWS Solution Architect course.

Found this cool tool to create my git readme:

with a few tweaks my github profile looks now like this, pretty happy with the result:
