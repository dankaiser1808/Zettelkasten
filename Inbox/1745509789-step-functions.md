# Step Functions

Step Functions address the issue of how can we pass a state between multiple Steps of a process? Since lambda doesn't save a state, it is hard to manage a state between lambda services. Step Functions ensure the order of the processing workflow, doesn't matter what kind of service is used. Step Functions give us a UI where we can define every step and what services integrate with it.

It is basically an ETL process builder where we can automate complex tasks through an UI that automate the execution of the services included in the workflow.
