# Inspector

Inspector scans our EC2, ECS and Lambda resources for software and vulnerability issues. It does that throughout the instances life cycle and triggers new scans if restarted or new changes are applied to those instances.

We have to define what Inspector should scan. We do this by defining Assessment Targets. It enables us to centralize vulnerability workloads of multiple accounts and environments. Furthermore, it's easy to start with, comes with responsive scanning and generates findings, customizable views and dashboards.

Types of vulnerabilities:

- Package vulnerability
- Code vulnerability
- Network vulnerability
