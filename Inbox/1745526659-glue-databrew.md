# Glue Databrew
Glue Databrew is a no code ETL service that uses an UI to create those ETL processes.

We can create a project, a so called workflow and define selected datasets. We can define scripts which are defined by a menu of operations inside the GUI. These scripts are referred as recipes and are used to run a Job as defined in the recipe.
