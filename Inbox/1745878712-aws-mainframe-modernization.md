# AWS Mainframe Modernization

AWS Mainframe is typically used to modernize legacy mainframe servers/applications, refactor them and run those servers in a modern cloud environment.

This process includes code and data conversion which are needed to run those tasks in the cloud.

One tool that is used for this process is called Blu Age and provides following features:
- Inventory analysis
- Dependency analysis
- Automated code transformation
- Scenario capture and management

If we just want to move to the cloud without any data conversion or refactoring we can use the replatforming utility to run the legacy mainframe server in the cloud.
