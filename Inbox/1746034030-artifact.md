# Artifact

Amazon itself has to undergo a lot of audits and tests for it's services to ensure that certain security and compliance standards are met, for example HIPAA. All those audit reports are accessible through AWS Artifact. It makes it easy to proof customers and governance that we meet certain compliances by downloading the audit rules and forward them.
