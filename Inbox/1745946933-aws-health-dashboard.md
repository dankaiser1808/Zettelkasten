# AWS Health Dashboard

Provides us information and guidance of AWS changes and issues. Public events are AWS widely scoped, private ones in specific regions. The AWS Health Dashboard also enables us to receive information about scheduled events and gives us alerts and notifications of the health of the resources.

With this we have higher reliability since we get more information what happens under the hood of AWS. We also get a Dashboard for AWS Health and our own Health Dashboard as well.
