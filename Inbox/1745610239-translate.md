# Translate
Translate is amazons language translation service. It recognizes the language that the user is sending to the service (chatbot) and translates the generated answer in the native language of the user accessing the bot.

We basically program one chatbot in one language and translate it in any other language based on the user.


The workflow is as follows:
1. Amazon S3 Input upload
2. AWS Lambda triggers Translate
3. Translate translates and uploads output to S3

Amazon Translate can also translate html files if needed.
