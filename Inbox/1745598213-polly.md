# Polly
Polly is Amazons text into voice service. Imagine we have a transcript of a Youtube video. Polly will transform the text to audio.

The key features are:
- Lifelike Speech
- Real-Time Streaming or File Generation
- SSML Support
- Lexicon Support
- Integration with other AWS services

Workflow:
1. Text Upload to S3
2. Triggers Lambda
3. Calls Polly for text to speech conversion
4. Polly converts to audio and saves the output to S3 or any other destination
