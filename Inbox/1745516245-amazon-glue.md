# Amazon Glue

Glue is a ETL service which main goal is to extract, transform and load data.
It does that by specifying an input source, where a defined crawler will pull the data and store it in a data catalog, which is enriched with metadata in a table like format. 

Ones the Glue Data Catalog is created, we can run Glue Jobs against the Catalog to transform the data and store it in a output destination like S3.

Features:
- Serverless ETL
- Data Catalog
- Automatic Schema Discovery
- ETL Job UI
- Lots of build in Libraries
