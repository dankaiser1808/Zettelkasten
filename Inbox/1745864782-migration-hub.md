# Migration Hub

The migration-hub is a management tool that helps us centralize the needs and steps from moving an on-prem infrastructure to the AWS cloud. It provides us with phases that help us to move our infrastructure in a structured way and centralizes multiple AWS services to manage the migration.

Discovery:
[[Application Discovery Service]]

Assess:
[[Application Migration Service]]

The migration-hub integrates with the AWS migration services like DMS and MGN and provides us with a centralized view of the migration process of our services.
