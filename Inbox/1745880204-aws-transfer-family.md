# AWS Transfer Family

This service provides us with the capability to transfer files between different AWS storage services like S3 or EFS.

We can use that to migrate data from on-premise systems to either S3 or EFS.
The AWS Transfer Family server is a fully managed FTP server that used differernt protocols to securely migrate the files.


The use cases are:
- For highly securely files that need to be transferred between multiple parties.
- Improved Collaboration across business applications
- Expand Content distribution

Transfer Family is mostly use to continuously transfer data between different stake holders, where data sync is used to transfer large amounts of data ones.
