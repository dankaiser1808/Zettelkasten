# CDK

Like CloudFormation or terraform, CDK is another IaC tool with the difference that it uses traditional programming languages to create the infrastructure.

It gives us much more flexibility than CloudFormation since CloudFormation uses YAML or JSON only.

Technically it uses CloudFormation under the hood to generate the infrastructure definitions in the end.
