# X-Ray

In a highly distributed architecture, it is very challenging to find the root cause of an error or issue with all the components of our architecture. X-Ray is a tracing tool that receives traces of all components and gives us information to root cause the issues we are facing.

A trace is a single request into our system. The entire process flow triggered by the request is one trace. A Trace has multiple segments and builds information how much time is used per segment.
