# Elastic Map Reduce
Elastic Map Reduce, also known as EMR, is a cluster that utilizes Hadoop or Spark on EC2 instances. These frameworks enable us to analyze large amount of data for business intelligence, workloads, machine learning analysis and lets us transform those large amounts of data.

Node Types:
- Primary Node: Coordinates distribution of data and tasks
- Core Node: Stores software components in a distributed file system and manages these
- Task Node: Processing node that executes data transformation.

Task nodes are optional.

After data is processed we can store it or send it to different services.

- EMR is a managed Hadoop Framework
- Scalability and Flexibilty
- Cost Effective Processing with Spot nodes.
- Integrates with multiple AWS Services.
