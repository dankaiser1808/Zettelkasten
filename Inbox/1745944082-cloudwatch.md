# CloudWatch

CloudWatch receives logs and metrics from different services (mostly application related data). We can also send directly logs through the api. We can use CloudWatch for monitoring based on the metrics, create alerts and trace requests.

Components:
- Metrics
- Alarms
- Logs
- Events (like trigger Lambda)
- Dashboards
- Insights

We can utilize CloudWatch with AutoScaling groups to scale based on metrics!
CloudWatch also provides a so called CloudWatch Agent which can be installed on on-premise instances to collect system-level metrics.
