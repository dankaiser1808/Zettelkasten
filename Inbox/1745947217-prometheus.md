# AWS Prometheus

Prometheus is like an open source version of CloudWatch, it provides us with metric aggregration and alert utilities. It pulls metrics from targets (application that provides prometheus endpoint). The retriever saves the data in a time series DB. After the data is stored, we can use the prometheus web server to query the metrics.

Amazon provides us with a managed solution that comes with:
- Scalability
- AWS integration (SNS after prometheus alert for example)
- Fully managed
- PromQL Support
- Cost Efficient
