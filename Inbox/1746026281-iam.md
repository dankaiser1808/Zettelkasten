# IAM

IAM is Amazons identity service which combines authentication and authorization.
IAM can manage auth for either users or services in our AWS account.

It provides us with enhanced security, a centralized management of auth, aligns with compliance and auditing, and implements the least privilege principle.

Components:

IAM User:
The actual individual using the an IAM user to perform actions in the account.
User can have permissions assigned. 

IAM Groups:
A group is a collection of IAM users with permissions assigned to the group instead of the user. This simplifies permissions management since we only need to define the permissions ones and add the users.

IAM Policy:
A JSON definition that contains multiple actions that a user should have access to or is being denied. We can list the actions and later on add the policy to the user or a group.
