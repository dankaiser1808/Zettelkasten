# Transcribe

Amazon Transcribe is the opposite of Polly, which generates speech from text. So Transcribe on the other hand, receives speech and turns it into text.
It stores the transcript in a S3 bucket for consumption and usage, and can also recognize multiple speakers (up to 10) in a conversation.
