Is an extension of the AWS CloudFormation that should help us to simplify the way of defining serverless resources. It comes with a CLI tool that's makes it easier for us to start creating serverless applications.  It uses serveless application resources which are defined in a SAM Template.

It holds information about Lambda functions, API Gateways and defines Outputs like a URL for example.


The SAM Template written in YAML provides the instructions for the application. We can store the application and the SAM Template in a S3 Bucket where Cloudformation will access both and deploy the serverless application structure.
