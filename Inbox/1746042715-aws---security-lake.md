# AWS - Security Lake

Security Lake was created to aggregate all logs from different data centers, AWS accounts and third party tools in a centralized state.

Securtiy Lake stores all logs in a S3 bucket. With this we can utilize other AWS services like Athena.
It also comes with data transformation and normalization utilities and works across multiple accounts and regions.
