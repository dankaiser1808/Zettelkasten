SageMaker is a AWS tool that we can use to host, train and run algorithms that predict outcomes for a certain use case.
We define a data source for example S3. We use Data Preparation tools like SageMaker Notebook or SageMaker Data Wrangler.
We can use it to train our models with training jobs where we combain the model and the data. 
Evaluation and tuning of the model for accurancy. 
Deploy models using SageMaker.
