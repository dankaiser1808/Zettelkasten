It focusses on rapid restoration in case of an emergency.

Resilience Hub is a centralize console which helps us to manage our disaster recovery plan for AWS resources.

We can manage and automate resilient activities like backups, schedules, setting recovery point objectives, recovery time objectives and many more.
