# CloudHSM (Hardware Security Module)

A hardware security module is used to store all our keys safely in a centralized place, instead of them being on multiple devices.

The data is sent to the HSM for Encryption/Decryption.
It gives an extra layer of security since AWS can not access the keys in the HSM.

Core features:
- Dedicated Hardware Security
- Full Control over Keys
- Scalability and Resilience
- Integrates with different services
- Regulatory Compliances

For critical data like banks or health, we might want to control the keys ourselves instead letting AWS manage the encryption keys (KMS).
