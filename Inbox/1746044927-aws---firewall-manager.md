# AWS - Firewall Manager

When we work with multiple AWS accounts we have to define all the firewall rules for all the accounts which is redundant workload. It also makes it harder to manage and maintain and meet compliance and audit specifications.

The firewall manager is the centralized place that handles all those rules and settings for the security related services and configurations across all our accounts and applications.
