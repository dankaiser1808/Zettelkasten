AWS gives companies that have on-premise systems the option to use Outpost. An outpost by definition is a remote location, which fits this service since Amazon will install a physical RACk in your on premise environment and connect it to the nearest AWS region through direct Connect or VPN. This gives companies a real hybrid experience using AWS. This is extremely useful since teams working between cloud and on-prem don't have to flip between both environments and can use the same services and tools. Outpost operates the same way as the cloud.
