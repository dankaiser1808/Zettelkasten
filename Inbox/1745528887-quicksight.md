# Quicksight
Quicksight is a dashboard and presentation tool for analytical data.
It provides this with appealing graphical visualizations to analyze data.
Some AWS services have direct integration with Quicksight like S3, Athena, RDS, Aurora, Redshift and Glue.
We can pull the data from those sources and visualize the data in Quicksight with dashboards.
It uses the SPICE, an in memory engine that gives us high speed data processing for responsive dashboards. It stores large datasets in memory, reducing query costs against the actual database.
