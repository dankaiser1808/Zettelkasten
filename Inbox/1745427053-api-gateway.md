# API Gateway

Api gateways help us to group multiple backend services together that will work as a central, single API. We can route certain traffic to a specific backend service based on the path, version, headers, etc.

This unifies our API and makes it easier to interact with, since we communicate always with the gateway itself.

We can also transform responses at the gateway based on the clients preferred format.

For security, it can also provide rate limiting and throttling processes.

Supports HTTP, websockets and REST.

The api gateway can forward traffic to a variety of AWS services, like:
- Lambda
- Beanstalk
- EC2
- S3
- DynamoDB
- Step Functions
- Kinesis
- RDS
- Cognito
- Secret Manager
