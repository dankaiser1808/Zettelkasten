# Launch Wizard

With the Launch Wizard we can simplify the deployment of third-party well-known applications. Some of those third-party applications need specific configurations to run properly and follow best practices for security and vulnerability. Launch Wizard provides us with templates to deploy those applications. 

It gives us cost estimates and resource recommendation and creates templates based of our configuration before deployment for reuse. 

Often for databases or complex applications like SAP.
