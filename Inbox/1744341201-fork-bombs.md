# fork bombs

A fork bomb is a denial-of-service (DoS) type of attack on Unix systems. By creating a large number of processes in a short period, the system will reach resource limits and crash.

It uses the fork() system call to create a copy of the current process in an infinite loop.

What makes this method dangerous is the fact that this works without sudo privileges and could lock the system into a state where only a hard reboot could solve the issue.
