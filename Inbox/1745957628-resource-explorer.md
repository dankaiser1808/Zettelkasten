# Resource Explorer

The explorer gives us the opportunity to search for our created resources across multiple regions using metadata, keywords or tags.

The Resource Explorer Admin is responsible to manage views and permissions for the explorer users.

A collection of information in a specific region is called an index.
There are two types of indexes:

- Local Index:
  collects data of a specific region
- Aggregator Index:
  collects data from all other regions.

Main Benefits are:
- Unified Search of resources
- Free to Use
- Saves Time
