# License Manager

Whenever we deploy applications on AWS like Oracle, SAP or SalesForce we need licenses that enables us to use the applications. Imagine we have hundreds of engineers in our company that require certain licenses. We don't want to over provision licenses and pay more money then needed. Managing those licenses for multiple teams and environments can be a very complex and time consuming task.

The License Manager takes care of this task by defining a license configuration. These normally include expiration dates, numbers of licenses purchased and to which servers these map to. After those configurations are applied, the manager ensure that the license is used as defined by the vendors rules. It also tracks the usage and creates reports that give us insights of the license usage.

Additionally, it can create templates for those licenses and supports multi account license management.
