# CloudTrail

CloudTrail tracks the actions of a user using the AWS api through console, cli or sdk by creating logs. Those are stored by default for 90 days. For extended storage, we have to save the logs in S3.

We can use this service with Athena or ElasticSearch to query the logs or use CloudWatch to ingest CloudTrail logs to trigger events/alarms based on those logs.

It helps us with auditing (making sure compliances are met) as well as insights of security incidents.
