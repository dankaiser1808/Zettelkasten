# AppFlow

In a company we normally have multiple departments that use different tooling and generate data, and require different data. 
AppFlow therefore aims to simplify the data transformation process, that otherwise has to be manually transformed into data lake or S3. This process is very complex and time consuming.

We define in AppFlow a source and a destination. This can be done by creating a AppFlow connector, which includes all necessary configurations to access the source and the destination. Then, we define a flow, which includes the mentioned source and destionation. Between those two, data will be transformed in the needed format.

The last part is the trigger. The trigger defines when the flow process should run.
AppFlow is used to bring different types of apps together.

Benefits of AppFlow are the speed and automation it comes with. No custom coding for data transformation.
Security and privacy is ensured through encrypted data at rest and on transit. It comes with large scaling options where a single flow can transform millions of Salesforce records to Zendesk tickets.
