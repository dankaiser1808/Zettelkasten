# Amazon MQ
Amazons managed message broker service for applications that use either Apache ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ. 
It basically is an alternative to SQS, since many applications and companies already use RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ, this makes it easier for companies to move into the AWS cloud, without rewriting the application to utilize SQS.

Amazon MQ features are as follows:
- Administration: Amazon operates the message broker for us
- Encryption at rest and transit
- Private Access isolation
- multiple instances based on hardware needs

UseCases:
- low latency event messaging
- Migrate with flexible configurations (Drop in Replacement ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ)
- Invoke Lambda functions
