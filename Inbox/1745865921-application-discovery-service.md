# Application Discovery Service

The Application Discovery Service provides us with two discovery options that will scan our servers for helpful information of the migration process.

The first one is the Agent Discovery, where we install an discovery agent on the server which gathers useful information about the server.

The second one is a Agentless discovery, which doesn't require installation on the server. This option deploys an agent on a VM that scans our infrastructure for the needed information.

It creates a Service (Application and Databases) Inventory List, CPU and Memory Usage Metrics and Network Utilization to conclude the necessary migration steps.
