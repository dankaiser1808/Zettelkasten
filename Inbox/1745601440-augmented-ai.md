# Augmented AI

Whenever input data gets labelled by any machine learning algorithm and has a low confidence level about the content, human review is mandatory. Augmented AI gives us the platform to make human reviews on the labelled data possible. It also adds the human review outcome back to the trained model to get higher confidence for future identification.

We can store the results in S3 based on confidence level if needed.
