# CloudFormation

CloudFormation is Amazons build in Infrastructure as Code solution.

We can define Templates that define the AWS resources we want to create and AWS will use this template to automatically create those resources.

Inside CloudFormation we write a template, create a stack (can be something like multiple env's) and deploy the infrastructure.

It also creates a change set form the last applied template and the new one to understand the changes before execution.
