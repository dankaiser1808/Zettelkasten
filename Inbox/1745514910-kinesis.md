# Kinesis

Kinesis is a data ingestion Tool that offers real time data processing. It includes the following services:
- Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: Takes different types of Input and streams it to EMR, EC2, Lambda or Kinesis Analytics
- Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose: Streaming data into storage location
- Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics: sql type queries while the data flows in Kinesis


Important to notice is that data stream and firehose are very similar, they just stream to a different output.
