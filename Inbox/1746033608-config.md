# Config
AWS Config tracks the configurations of all our AWS resources and records/monitors the changes over time. We can specify rules for resource configurations so that it meets compliance standards. This tool will record and take corrective actions based on set policy. Sends notification on configurations changes. It comes with predefined rules, but we can also create our own rules. We can trigger lambdas or other events based on Config alerts.
