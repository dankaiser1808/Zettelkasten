# AWS Proton

At larger scale, a microservice architecture can very easily get very complicated and time consuming to manage and understand. As Administrators and DevOps Engineers, we don't want our developers to waste their time thinking about the infrastructure every time they want to deploy a service. We want them to focus on writing code.

The problem with microservices is that mostly every microservice will be handled by a different team. This leads to inconsistencies of our applications and can cause reliability issues, since when we troubleshoot we end up looking into always different environments.

With Proton, The platform team or Administrators can create infrastructure as code templates that will create the infrastructure for the developer teams.
