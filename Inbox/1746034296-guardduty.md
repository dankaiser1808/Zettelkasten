# GuardDuty

GuardDuty is a security services that continuously monitors for suspicious and malicious activity. It uses machine learning algorithms to determine unauthorized access, compromised instances, and potentially harmful network traffic.

It also comes with alerts and insights which enable us to quickly respond to incidents.

It does all of it by analyzing the logs provided by the services. GuardDuty can trigger other services on detection like a lambda or SNS notification.

All findings receive a severity score, the higher the severer the issue.
