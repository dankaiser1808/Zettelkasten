#aws

Lambda is a serverless AWS service, which gives us the opportunity to upload our code and run it based on defined triggers. The beauty of lambda is that it scales based on the incoming traffic and only runs based on our defined triggers. Those triggers are very different from one another giving us a lot of flexibility when to run our code.


Main Features:
- Serverless no server to manage for the user
- Event-Driven (Triggers)
- Lot's of languages are supported
- Fault tolerance based on scaling and high availability through multiple AZ's
