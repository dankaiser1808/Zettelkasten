#consume #aws 


Basically the same services in our own data center on a on premise system. We can still interact with both Services using the EKS/ECS dashboard, perfectly fitting into the aws services.

- On Premise
- Consistent Kubernetes experience on prem and cloud
- Deployments will be easier since on-prem and cloud are similar/identical
- Various infrastructure is supported.
- Data is kept on-prem for highly regulated data.
