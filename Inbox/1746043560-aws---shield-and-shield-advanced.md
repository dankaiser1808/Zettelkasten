# AWS - Shield and Shield Advanced

Amazons distributed denial of service attack protection service.
In short, it protects us from DDos attacks.

AWS Shield comes for free and by default from AWS and protects us from SYN and UDP floods and other layer 3 and 4 related attacks.

Shield Advanced is a payed service for around 3000$ a month that comes with a 24/7 Ddos Support Team and protects more services from DDos attacks like ELB, CloudFront, Global Accelerator and Route 53. Those attacks can result in higher AWS bills, those costs are going to be covered by AWS.

Summarized, AWS Shield Advanced comes with:
- WAF integration
- Configuration option for automatic response for layer 7 attacks
- Integrates with Aamazon Route 53 health checks for detection.
- AWS Shiled Response Team
- Proactive Engagement of AWS
