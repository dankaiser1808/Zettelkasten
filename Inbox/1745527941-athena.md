# Athena

Athena enables us to specify a source and upload the data into a table structure. With this, we can run SQL queries against the data. In Athena, we define the source, the table columns and the name of the database to use.

Example:
We can upload a csv file in S3, specify the file in Athena and define the table columns. After that, we can run SQL queries against it.
